# üåü Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree 

Online course on Data Analysis with Python and SQL. 

At the end of the course, I would have learn how to:
- Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. 
- Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
- Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
- Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. 
- Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.
- Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. 
- Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

## Part 1: Welcome to the Nanodegree Program

### üå§ Project #1 Explore Weather Trends
View my project **[here](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%201:%20Welcome/Project%20%231:%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends/Project%201%20-%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends.ipynb)**!

**Skills learnt:**
- Extract data from database using `SQL` query.
- Manipulate data and create data visualization using `Python`.
- Interpret and prepare a write up using `Jupyter Notebook` describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the city where I live.

## Part 2: Introduction to Data Analysis

There are 5 steps to the data analysis process.

- Step 1: Ask Questions
- Step 2: Wrangle Data
- Step 3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Step 4: Draw Conclusions (or, Predictions)
- Step 5: Communicate your Results

### üç∑ Case Study #1 Wine Quality

**Skills learnt:**
- Ask questions associated to the red and white wine samples data.
- Assess data by finding out shape and information, duplicated rows, unique values and mean.
- Wrangle data by appending new arrays for wine colours and combining the data sets.
- Create visualizations using Matplotlib and drawing conclusions
- Communicating results by answering the questions
